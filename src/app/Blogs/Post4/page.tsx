        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by
        machines. It enables systems to perform tasks that typically require
        human cognition, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and
        decision-making. <br />
        <br />
        AI comes in various forms, including: <br />
        ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning (ML): Where machines learn from data to make
        predictions or decisions. <br />
        ðŸ“ŒNatural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand
        and interact using human language. <br />
        ðŸ“ŒComputer Vision: Allowing machines to interpret visual data like
        images and videos. <br />
        <br />
        From chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars and medical
        diagnosis systems, AI is transforming industries by making processes
        faster, smarter, and more efficient. In essence, AI is about empowering
        machines to think and act intelligently, making it a cornerstone of
        modern technology.
